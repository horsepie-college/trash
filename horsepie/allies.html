                Over time, Silas' reputation spread far and wide, attracting like-minded individuals seeking companionship and excitement. These fellow seekers became his closest friends and strongest allies, each bringing unique skills and personalities to the team. Here are some of the notable members of Silas' crew:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sonic the Hedgehog: This speed demon brings his legendary quickness and agility to bear in combat, dashing through enemy lines and delivering devastating attacks. Despite their differing natures (Sonic is more serious and focused), Silas and Sonic share a deep respect for each other and work seamlessly together in battle.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Knuckles the Echidna: As an expert climber and skilled fighter, Knuckles provides valuable support during missions. Though initially skeptical of Silas due to his carefree nature, Knuckles came to appreciate Silas' bravery and selflessness, recognizing a kindred spirit in the silly man.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Aero the Acrobat: A brilliant aerialist and acrobat, Aero joins the group to lend her impressive agility and flight capabilities. Her grace and precision complement Silas' own brand of chaos, making them an unstoppable duo in tight spaces.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Ristar the Shooting Star: A brave young star warrior from the cosmos, Ristar contributes his powerful plasma blasts and energetic fighting style. Due to his innocence and pureheartedness, Silas takes a paternal role towards Ristar, guiding him on his journey throughout the galaxy.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bonus Karnage: An armored anthropomorphic rabbit and renowned bounty hunter, Karnage partners up with Silas to tackle dangerous assignments. Despite their polar opposite demeanors (Karnage is hard-nosed and unforgiving), their shared love of challenge and thrills keeps them working closely together.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Toejam & Earl: These two extraterrestrial funkslingers bring their trademark comedic timing and hip-hopping moves to the team. Thanks to their knowledge of intergalactic cultures and customs, Toejam and Earl prove essential assets in navigating unusual planets and interacting with strange lifeforms.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Alex Kidd: Alex Kidd rounds out the roster as another stalwart friend and trusted advisor. With his intelligence, strategic thinking, and innate leadership qualities, he offers sage counsel and sound guidance whenever needed. While sometimes playing the straight man to Silas' antics, Alex understands the value of levity and camaraderie, ensuring everyone stays connected despite the constant demands of protecting the universe.</li>
              </ul>
